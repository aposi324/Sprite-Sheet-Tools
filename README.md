# Sprite-Sheet-Tools
Scripts to make mass edits to GIF format sprites more efficient.

# Sprite Sheet Maker
This script compiles all the GIFs in the scripts local folder into a single spritesheet, out.PNG, with saved data to allow splitting of the sprites back into their original GIF format. Saves the data to sprtesheet.dat.

# Sprite Sheet Splitter
This script separates a sheet created by Sprite Sheet Maker back into individual GIFs, saved to the current directory. This is useful for editing the GIFs on one spritesheet, and then separating them back into individual files.
